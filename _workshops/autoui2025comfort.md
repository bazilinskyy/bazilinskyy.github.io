abstract: "Passenger comfort and perceived safety, as two psychological states, are crucial for user acceptance of automated driving. The accurate measurement of these passenger states contributes to human-centred designs for automated vehicles and developing predictive models for providing personalised settings. However, practical challenges and best practices are rarely discussed in the literature. This workshop aims to address this gap by creating a forum to synthesise current practices and explore novel, effective measurement approaches. The session includes expert talks on subjective, objective, and model-based measurement methodologies, and interactive breakout sessions. Participants will critically evaluate existing methodologies and design future multi-modal strategies, including incorporating artificial intelligence (AI). The workshop will produce numerous outcomes, including the collaborative development of a research outlook and a methodological paper for knowledge sharing."

 Introduction<img width=10/>      | 13:45–13:55<img width=70/>        | *Welcome and introduction*. Introduction of organisers and guest speakers. Overview of the workshop goals, activities, and schedule. Division of participants into two breakout groups.
 Session 1         | 13:55–15:05        | *Setting the scene*. Organisers’ Introduction (10 min): Definitions of comfort and perceived safety, overview of current measurement approaches, and identification of existing challenges and gaps. Expert Talks (60 min): 1. Subjective methods: their benefits and limitations. 2. Objective methods: challenges in physiological and behavioural data use (e.g., artefact removal, variability). 3. AI-based models: insights and lessons from applying AI for passenger state detection.                                                                 
 Break      | 15:05–15:10        | Coffee break.                                               
 Session 2         | 15:10–15:50        | *Group discussions*. Task 1: Critical assessment (20 min): Participants evaluate challenges and share solutions based on measurement categories (subjective, objective). Output is visualised on a shared whiteboard. Task 2: Designing future methods (20 min): Groups propose a multi-modal framework for continuous comfort and safety assessment, integrating subjective, objective, and behavioural data. Special focus is placed on the role of AI/LLMs in real-time inference.  
 Closing           | 15:50–16:25        | *Reflections abd wrap-up*. Moderators summarise group outputs (20 min). Final reflections and closing words from the organisers (5 min).
