abstract: "This study presents a voice-operated automotive user interface (UI) with ambient color feedback, designed to enhance driver interaction and safety by providing more noticeable and aesthetically pleasing visual cues through peripheral vision. An online survey (N = 151) showed a strong preference for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay over the UI of the car manufacturers, with users favoring consistency between the UI of their car and the digital ecosystem of their phone. A user study (N = 24) compared ambient visual feedback with conventional and no feedback, with 18 participants preferring the ambient method, which significantly improved visibility and assistance value. These findings suggest that ambient visual feedback enhances automotive UIs."
