abstract: "This paper conducts a comprehensive cross-cultural analysis of pedestrian behaviour during road crossings using global driving video datasets. As urban landscapes continue to evolve, understanding the diverse behaviours of pedestrians becomes crucial for ensuring safe interactions in both manual and autonomous vehicle environments. Through an extensive review of pedestrian studies from developed and developing countries, this research identifies key factors—cultural norms, socioeconomic conditions, infrastructure quality, and regulatory frameworks—that influence crossing behaviours. Our findings demonstrate distinct regional patterns: pedestrians in developed regions tend to follow structured, rule-based behaviours supported by strict traffic regulations and advanced infrastructure. Conversely, in developing regions, pedestrian behaviour is more informal and adaptive, shaped by variable infrastructure and a rich mix of cultural influences. These insights are critical for developing transportation systems that are responsive to the varied dynamics of pedestrian movement worldwide. By highlighting these differences, the study aids in the design of both manual and automated vehicles, ensuring they can safely navigate complex urban environments. This research provides valuable guidelines for improving pedestrian safety and enhancing the interaction between pedestrians and vehicles globally."
