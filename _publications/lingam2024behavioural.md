abstract: "Drones are being tested in healthcare settings to deliver medicines or equipment to humans during emergencies. Understanding how people perceive drone behaviour, specifically in terms of approach trajectories and delivery methods, and identifying factors that induce uncertainty is crucial for safety and trust. This VR experiment investigated the impact of approach trajectories and delivery methods on feelings of uncertainty. Forty-five participants observed drones following straight or curved paths, delivering packages by landing or using a cable while hovering above eye level. Participants felt uncertain and unsafe, especially when looking up at straight-line drone paths. Curved paths were perceived as less uncertain and by some commented as more natural, trustful, and safe. Uncertainty arose during landing attempts due to collision concerns and altitude changes. Using a cable for delivery reduced uncertainty and increased safety. The study recommends drones avoid hovering near humans, especially after landing attempts, to address uncertainty."
