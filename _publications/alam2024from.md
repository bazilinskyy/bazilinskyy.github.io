abstract: "User interfaces are crucial for easy travel. To understand user preferences for travel information during automated shuttle rides, we conducted an online survey with 51 participants from 8 countries. The survey focused on the information passengers wish to access and their preferences for using mobile, private, and public screens during boarding and travelling on the bus. It also gathered opinions on the usage of Near-Field Communication (NFC) for shuttle bus confirmation and viewing assistance to help passengers stand precisely where the shuttle will arrive, overcoming navigation and language barriers. Results showed that 72.6% of participants indicated a need for NFC and 82.4% for viewing assistance. There was a strong correlation between preferences for shuttle bus schedules, route details (r=0.55), and next-stop information (r=0.57) on mobile screens, suggesting that passengers who value one type of information are likely to value related kinds too."
