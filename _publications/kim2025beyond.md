abstract: "In automated vehicles, beeps are widely used as alarms and feedback. However, as automation advances, there is a need to explore subtler, contextually sound-based notifications for non-urgent situations. While auditory interfaces for take-over requests have been studied, limited attention has been given to using soundscapes for such alerts. This paper designed and evaluated soundscapes using existing driving-related sounds – amplified road noise and/or dimmed background music – for scheduled take-over situations. A driving simulator study showed that these soundscapes enhanced reaction time, situation awareness, and acceptance without causing annoyance. Particularly, the combined condition (music dimming and road noise amplifying) supported higher driver awareness and responsiveness. These findings suggest that soundscapes can offer safer, more intuitive take-over alerts by embedding information into familiar audio cues. This study contributes to developing soundscapes as novel alert mechanisms that integrate seamlessly with the driving environment to enhance both safety and user experience in automated vehicles."
