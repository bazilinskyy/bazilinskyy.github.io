#### Introduction
There are numerous examples where technology has been used for enhancing and teaching social skills or creating social agents. Example domains are social innovation, education, and connecting in everyday life settings. Within this course, we provide mechanisms, technological solutions, and a vision of how the design of technological systems can simulate social agency and promote interaction. An essential part of these mechanisms is related to embodying learning algorithms (computational intelligence/artificial intelligence) in interactive robots and other products.

#### My role
- 2024â€“: lecturer.

#### Learning goals
- **L1**. Learn to develop technological concepts and solutions (algorithms and hardware) that can promote behavioral changes and social interaction.
- **L2**. Learn to use learning algorithms as an interaction design tool to enhance the quality of interaction with and between humans.
- **L3**. Learn the basic concepts of Explainable AI as a method for enhancing the interactions with technology.
- **L4**. Learn to integrate all the above in a embodied objects, robots, or online solutions that interact in a certain context.
